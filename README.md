# THREE.js Pixel Art Experiment ðŸ•¹

> A THREE.js renderer that produces pixel art-esque visuals.

## Check out the [demo](https://ethanthatonekid.github.io/threejs-pixel-experiment/)!

## Technique ðŸŽ¨

To create this effect, I rendered [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) geometries on a very small canvas (32 pixels by 32 pixels to be exact).
Then, I scaled up the canvas using CSS.
Using a special CSS property, I scaled the canvas in a way that maintains the sharp edges of the pixels.
The CSS property in question is called [`image-rendering`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image-rendering).
When `image-rendering` is set to `pixelated`, the browser scales the rendered image without fuzzing the edges of each source pixel.
